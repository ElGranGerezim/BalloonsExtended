Mod inspired by my angst that I couldn't put a horseshoe on bundle of balloons.

Currently adds 8 items:

Horseshoe Bundle of Balloons - Combines lucky horseshoe and bundle of balloons
Obsidian Horseshoe Bundle of Balloons - Combines bundle of balloons and obsidian horseshoe
Obsidian Horseshoe variant for all 6 of the balloon accessories. (Named "<Color> Balloon Type OH")

I plan to create new balloon bundles when I have time.
